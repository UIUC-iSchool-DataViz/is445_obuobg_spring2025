## This course

<img src="images/week15.png" width="95%">

notes:
Look at all the stuff we covered!

---

## Extra credit: Network Viz & SciViz

notes:
keep in mind that we have 2 extra credit assignments, worth 0.75 of a homework grade, that is in this week's page

also recall that the maximum you can get on the homework is 100% of that category, so if you have a perfect HW score, you can't do better than that!

---

## Extra credit Lab:Altair -- available on 12/11

**Announcement will be made when available -- stay tuned!**

Will have usual "Lab" format + feedback survey.

Worth 75 points, due 12/18.

notes:
There will be a Lab that folks can choose to do available on the 11th (probably later in the day).  

I'll send out an announcement for this when it is "live".

The 75 points will be split into the actual lab component and then a feedback survey.

# TOPIC 1: Where to go from here

notes:
different sub-fields of dataviz will lead you down different pathways

---

## Python-based things

 * See whats in dev on the [bqplot gitter lobby](https://gitter.im/bloomberg/bqplot)
 * More about volume rendering with [ipyvolume](https://ipyvolume.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
 * More about sciviz dev with [yt slack](https://yt-project.slack.com/join/shared_invite/enQtMzQ4Nzk1Mjk0ODY4LWNmOTFiNTM4N2ExZWYyY2YwZDUxN2Q1MTgwNDdjZGExMWM0Y2VlNzUzNGExZTZhMWRlNjU3ZjFmZmU3MjdkNDg)

notes:
these are a few more resources for Python based development, including some 3D stuff we didn't get to including ipyvolume and more about yt (yt is part of the sciviz extra credit)

---

## Javascript

 * [Beginning Javascript course](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/introduction-to-javascript)
 * [IS 439: Web Development](https://ischool.illinois.edu/degrees-programs/courses/is439) -- more application-based
 * [IS 449: Web Application Development](http://catalog.illinois.edu/courses-of-instruction/is/) -- offered infrequently

notes:
we didn't really touch on javascript TOO much, we mainly used it "under the hood" but there are some other resources
