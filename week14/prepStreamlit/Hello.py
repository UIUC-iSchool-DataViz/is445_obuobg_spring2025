 * Add in a sidebar on our main page to view all pages

First, let's rename our `app.py` file to `Hello.py`.

1. `3_Altair_Plots.py`

**NOTE: The formatting here of the file names is specific!** It determines their order and how they appear on the sidebar.

1. A `set_page_config` call, including a title and an icon
1. A message displayed on page selection with a `sidebar.header` call

Once this is done, we can then move the items from our original `app.py` file to each page.
