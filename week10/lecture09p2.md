# TOPIC 2: Final Projects

---

## Final Project

There are three components, turned in the last three weeks of class.

You will have three general components:

1. Viz for Self (Due November 20 - individual)
1. Viz for Peers (Due December 4 - group)
1. Viz for Others (Due December 11 (for feedback), December 18 (final) - part group/part individual)

Be aware:
 * **NO** extensions for these assignments.
 * There is a group-submission option (sign up open, reminder in a few weeks!).

note:
there are NO extensions available -- you can't use one of your three HW extensions for these components

also, parts 2 & 3 will be in a group, however you will pick your own groups AND you can be in a group of 1 if you want -- instructions about this process will be in an announcement later this week

---

## Groups (Parts 2 & 3)

* Group size: maximum 4, minimum 1 (i.e. doing the final on your own)
* Sign up on Canvas under `People` $\rightarrow$ `Groups`
* Want to find a group?  Check out the **`#find-a-group-b-section`** channel on Slack (**make sure it is NOT the** `a-section` **that is another class!**)
* Group sign-up closes November 11


---

## Final Project: Part 1 -- Individual

Submit in a Jupyter notebook.

 * Identify a dataset to explore.
   * This will be iterative!  You probably won't get one you like on the first
     try.
   * Check out sources like [data.world](https://data.world/),
     [data.illinois.gov](https://data.illinois.gov/),
     [data.gov](https://data.gov/),
     [developer.marvel.com](https://developer.marvel.com/),
     [IDB](https://databank.illinois.edu/), etc.
   * or the dataset doc that [lives right here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15UJinT5XokAHXd9fQAYD8f6d3vEkR6kJMq8kswmkOhY/edit?usp=sharing)
 * Explore the dataset in a Jupyter notebook.  Make sure you include things that did and did not work.
 * Summarize the characteristics of the dataset in words: what does it
   represent, what are the fields/columns/rows, what data types are they, etc
   
note:
this will be the overview in general if you are doing an individual submission, for group we'll look at the requirements in a moment on the Canvas page

---

## Final Project: Part 1 -- Individual (cont)

Your datasets need to be submitted as well.  To do this, include this
information in your Jupyter notebook:

 * What is the "name" of the dataset?
 * Where did you obtain it?
 * Where can we obtain it?  (i.e., URL)
 * What is the license of the dataset?  What are we allowed to do with it?
 * How big is it in file size and in items?
 * Make a simple plot showing a relationship of interest.  You can use matplotlib or pandas (or other). Don't worry about colors, labels or anything else of that nature!

Be aware: You *must* make a plan for large datasets (larger than GitHub's upload limits).


---

## Final Project: Part 1 -- Individual (cont, cont)

You can share raw data sets and sources, ask questions about reading/modifying the dataset and post code to do so **that isn't working**.

Please do not share processed or cleaned datasets online.

---

## Final Project: Part 2

Submit in a Jupyter notebook.  

Be aware:
 * This should use the *same dataset* as Part 1.
 * Dashboard requirement (like Lab #5)

See Assignment description for more details. (You can see a PDF of a draft of the assignment on Canvas + rubric now, the full assignment will be come visible after groups are uploaded.)

note:
This part of the project will be like Lab #5 (which we know is a toughy!) -- if you didn't do well on Lab #5 and want to walk through how to approach this problem feel free to pop by office hours (mine or the TA's) and we'll walk you through it (any office hours should do, we all have the solutions :D )

Heads up that you can't really see any of this assignment on PL until you are in a group, but there is a PDF of an old version from last it was taught on a Canvas Module, 

---

## Final Project: Part 3

Visualization for the public -- see Assignment description for more details.

You will submit this as your final project and get some feedback -- both from the instructors and in the forum from your peers.

You will also provide feedback for 3 other students/groups (more on this later).

Your group will also submit a video discussing your work as part of this submission.

notes:
Heads up that like with Part 2, you can't really see any of this assignment on PL until you are in a group, but there is a PDF of an old version from last it was taught on a Canvas Module, just note some things will change sine we are doing streamlit instead of starboard.  

In addition to starboard becoming streamlit, the rubrics will change a bit.

Also be aware that your group will be required to submit a video discussing your work.  More info on this in a few weeks!






---

## Final Project: Part 3 (cont)

You will submit a link to a github pages site or webpage/app that you/your group has constructed.

This component will include a "for others" visualization that is deeply
narrative with appropriate interactive (or static) content which is sharable on a
website.

Some possible ways to approach this:

 * Jekyll+Altair (see template)
 * Raw HTML + Javascript
 * ~~Starboard website~~ Streamlit app
 * We will *not* be accepting jupyter notebooks/mybinder links this semester
